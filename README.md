# vsd
This repository contains .ipynb files to extract formant measures from .wav and .TextGrid files and to calculate vowel space density (VSD) as a basis for vowel space area measures (density-controlled vowel space area). The calculation is based on the methodology described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4983342">Story & Bunton (2017)</a>.

Due to limitations to public access, the .wav and .TextGrid files used in this demonstration of the method are not available in this repository. The .ipynb file `01_extract_formants` cannot be re-run, but can be used as a reference. However, the .csv file generated by this notebook (data/formants.csv) can be accessed and used to implement code in the .ipynb file `02_vsd.ipynb`.
